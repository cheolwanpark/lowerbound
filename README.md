# 🛡️ Crypto Risk Advisor

AI-powered risk management for smarter, safer crypto investing.
No price predictions — just knowledge, risk control, and confidence.


# 🚨 Problem

1. Low Understanding of Crypto Finance

Most investors lack a proper understanding of key crypto concepts like perpetual futures, DeFi mechanics, and liquidation thresholds — resulting in unexpected exposure and repeated losses.

2. Speculation Over Strategy

Retail crypto investors often rely on short-term, highly leveraged speculation rather than structured planning.
In high-volatility environments, this leads to forced liquidations, emotional decisions, and long-term burnout.

3. Loss → Misinformation → Distrust

Insufficient knowledge leads to losses → losses create misinformation and negative sentiment → that drives people away from learning or re-entering the market.
This cycle keeps individual investors stuck in a loop of losses, misinformation, and fear — pushing them out of the market before they ever learn how to manage risk properly.

# 💊 Solution — The Painkiller

“Invest with knowledge. Manage risk. Reflect your preferences.”

✅ Build personalized crypto portfolios using AI-driven risk profiling
✅ Combine spot, futures, and DeFi positions to minimize drawdown and increase resilience
✅ Perform stress tests based on real crash scenarios (e.g., BTC -30%, UST depeg, FTX collapse)
✅ Provide clear explanations for each asset allocation and risk rationale
✅ Support natural-language inputs, like:

“Max drawdown 15%, only major assets, hedge with stables.”
